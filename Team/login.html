            When you first start TEAM you will be presented with a Login
            Page.</big> <big><br>

                    User Names and Passwords</b><br>
                <br>
                Your user name and password is set by the TEAM coordinator.
                Only the TEAM coordinator can assign logins and passwords
                via the special TEAM-ADM App. You can select "Remember Me"
                to have TEAM save your user name and password for subsequent
                easy logins. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Administrative and Normal Users<br>
                    <br>
                </b>TEAM provides for two kinds of users. An administrative
                user will have the ability to add/change/delete entries in
                the TEAM system. Normal users will only be able to view TEAM
                data. Your TEAM coordinator will assign you to one of the
                user types. <br>
                <b><br>
                    Forgotten Passwords</b><br>
                <br>
                When your TEAM coordinator added your User Name to the
                system, your EMAIL address was also entered and associated
                with your User Name. If you forgot your password, you can
                request TEAM to send you the password. You will be prompted
                to enter your EMAIL address that TEAM will use to send the
                password to. If EMAIL you enter is not in the TEAM system
                associated with a user/login you will be told that TEAM
                couldn't find the EMAIL address. If this happens you should
                contact your TEAM coordinator who can reset your password
                for you.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Logging Off or Changing User's</b><br>
                <br>
                It is possible that you have been assigned a user login for
                administrative purposes as well as a normal view only user
                login. If you need to logoff TEAM to login as a different
                user, just go to the main Help page and click on the Logout
                button. This will exit TEAM and allow you to re-start the
                TEAM App to login as another user.<br>
