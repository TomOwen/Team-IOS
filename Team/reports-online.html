        <b><big><big>Patient Scan Reports and Study Reports Online</big></big></b><br>
        <br>
        <big><big>TEAM provides you with the option of storing and
            displaying patient scan reports and study information.<br>
            <br>
            Just like TEAM allows you the option of storing and displaying
            images/movies associated with a patient, written
            reports/information about the scan or study can also be
            optionally saved and displayed.<br>
            <br>
            If your radiologist has produced a scan report TEAM can store
            that file and make it available to you via your TEAM server -
            your TEAM document/image server setup by your TEAM Coordinator.<br>
            <br>
            Also, if you have standardized information or just internal
            details about a particular study or clinical trial, you can
            store that document online and have it easily available via
            TEAM.<br>
            <br>
            Most standard file formats are supported for documents on TEAM
            (i.e. doc, pdf, txt). <br>
            <b><br>
                Adding a Patient Scan Report to TEAM</b><br>
            <br>
            <img alt="scan on" src="scan-details-on.tiff"><br>
                <br>
                As you are entering scan details (i.e. lesions etc.), TEAM will
                identify the file name of the scan report that you must use to
                identify the report. In order to activate the scan reporting
                capability you need to set the "Online Scan Report Is" switch to
                "ON". This will then enable the "View Scan Report" button for
                you to view the scan report after you have uploaded the scan
                report with the designated file name. The file name consists of
                the patient ID and scan date(mmddyy) and the document type. (The
                doc type is set by your TEAM Coordinator via TEAM-ADMIN).<br>
                <br>
                <b>Adding a Study or Clinical Trial Document to TEAM</b><br>
                <br>
                Study and/or Clinical Trial documents can be very </big></big><big><big>valuable
                    to have available online. In addition to just documents, TEAM
                    allows you to associate an HTML file for the document that gives
                    you the ability to easily point to any internet location. For
                    instance you may want to include a HTML file for a given study
                    that will point you automatically to the NCI Clinical Trial page
                    for that study.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To add a study document to TEAM you can do so on either the ADD
                    Study screen or the Study Detail screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img alt="study doc" src="study-doc.tiff"><br>
                        <br>
                        The study document file name is up to you to choose. This will
                        give you the flexibility to assign that study document to
                        multiple studies. This would be useful if you had an internal
                        document that applied to more than one study.<br>
                </big></big><big><big><br>
                    The file must be placed on your TEAM document/image server by
                    your TEAM Coordinator.<br>
                    <br>
