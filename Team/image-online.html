        <big><big><b>Viewing of Scan Images<br>
            <br>
        </b>Patient scans are normally processsed by your radiologist.
            During this process the radiologist can "capture" a
            picture/image of a lesion to be stored for viewing by TEAM. This
            is an optional feature of TEAM. A staff member could also
            capture the image if the radiologist has not been assigned this
            responsibility. This facility can be enabled on individual
            lesion basis.<br>
            <br>
            Scan images (i.e. jpeg etc.) are captured and stored on your
            TEAM server. Your radiologist or the TEAM Coordinator would
            perform a screen capture of each of lesions that they wish to
            include as displayable on TEAM. Those images would then be
            uploaded to your TEAM server. Special naming of each of the
            images is required to associate the image with a patient. The
            filename is automatically generated for your use on the lesion
            add/edit screens.<br>
            <br>
            <img alt="lesion edit" src="lesion-edit.tiff"><br>
                <br>
                When viewing an image with TEAM, you can zoom in on an area of
                the image. The Patient, scan date and lesion # are automatically
                added to the displayed image.<br>
                <br>
                <img alt="scan" src="scan-image.tiff"><br>
        </big></big> <br>
        <big><big><big><small><br>
            <b>Comparing Two images of the same lesion</b><br>
            <br>
            A very powerful feature of the TEAM system is the ability to
            view scan images of a lesion from two different scan dates -
            side by side.<br>
            <br>
            To view and compare two images first choose "Compare 
            Scans" from the Patient Data screen as follows.<br>
            <br>
            <img alt="patient data" src="patient-data.tiff"><br>
                <br>
                Now you will see two lists of Lesion images for various scan
                dates. Only lesions that have been captured and stored for
                viewing will show up in these tables. Also the "Image
                Online" switch setting in the Lesion Edit screen must have
                been set to the ON position.<br>
                <br>
                <img alt="choose image" src="choose-image.tiff"><br>
                    <br>
                    You need to choose both a before and after selection from
                    the tables before you can have TEAM retrieve the images.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img alt="compare" src="compare-images.tiff"><br>
                        <br>
                        You now can zoom in on each of the images for comparison.<br>
