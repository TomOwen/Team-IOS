            to TEAM is the "Patients" screen. You can always come back to
            this initial screen by clicking on the bottom TAB bar icon
            called "Patients".<br>

                <br>
                The search text entry field will search all of the patients,
                doctors and studies to find all the patients matching your
                input. <br>

                    Adding a New Patient</b><br>
                <br>
                If you have a login that has "Administrative" capabilities, then
                you will be able to add a new patient by clicking on the "+"
                button in the top toolbar.<br>
                <br>
                <img alt="new-patient" src="new-patient.tiff"><br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Name:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    You can enter the patient name here. If you do not wish to have
                    the full name entered, then you can enter just the patient
                    initials or any description you feel appropriate.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ID#:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    The patient ID# is very important and must be a unique number or
                    character (i.e. AD124321, 782314, etc.). Do include any spaces
                    within the ID# as the ID# will be used to name the document and
                    image files for the patient. Document and images files stored on
                    your WEB server are an optional component of TEAM.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Study:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    You assign each patient to a study or clinical trial. A chooser
                    will popup allowing you to pick the appropriate study or trial.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Doctor:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    You assign each patient to a doctor. A Chooser will popup
                    allowing you to pick the appropriate doctor.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Saving the New Patient</b><br>
                    <br>
                    When you are done adding the fields to the patient screen, you
                    must click on the "Save" button in the top right of the Tool
                    Bar. A message will tell you that the "Patient ID#" was properly
                    saved. Once that patient has been saved, the next patient can be
                    entered on the same screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Patient Data - Changing Name, Study, or Doctor</b><br>
                    <br>
                    From the Patient screen you can select a patient to edit and
                    view patient history and much more from the Patient Data screen.
                    Click on one of the patients to display the Patient Data screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img alt="patient data" src="patient-data.tiff"><br>
                        <br>
                        You can change the patient Name, Study and Doctor on this
                        screen. Remember to click on the "Save" button at the top right
                        Tool Bar.<br>
                        <br>
                        From this screen you can obtain the patient's response (i.e.
                        Complete, Partial, Stable, Progressive), enter and/or modify
                        patient scan information, and if you have chosen to store scan
                        images you can compare 2 images side-by-side from different scan
                        dates,<br>
