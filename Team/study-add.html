                    <b>Study Number:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Enter a study identifier such as NCT12345.<br>

                    Enter the sponsor name such as Bristol Myers or "Internal-100"
                    etc.<br>

                    <br>
                    This field is optional. If you enter a file name, then it will
                    be used by the "Study Detail" screen (accessed from the
                    "Studies" screen when you select a study) to allow you to view
                    that file. Normally this file will be either a Word document
                    (.doc) or a PDF (.pdf).<br>
                    <br>
                    Enter a filename such as bms12345.doc<br>
                    <br>
                    When you go to the "Study Detail" screen you will see a "View
                    Study Document" button allowing you to view the current
                    document.<br>

                    <b>Partial Response % Decrease</b><br>
                    <br>
                    If the study is using the standard RECIST critieria for
                    determining response, you can leave the default value of 30. Any
                    lesion that has a size (longest diameter) decrease of 30% or
                    more will be classified as a Partial Response.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Progressive Disease % Increase</b><br>
                    <br>
        </big></big><big><big>If the study is using the standard RECIST
            critieria for determining response, you can leave the default
            value of 20. Any lesion that has a size (longest diameter)
            increase of 20% or more will be classified as a Progressive
            Disease.<br>
            <br>
            Complete Response will always be a 100% decrease in size and
            Stable Disease will always be defined as lesions that do not
            fall between Partial Response and Progressive Disease.<br>
