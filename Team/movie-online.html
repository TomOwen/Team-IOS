        <big><big><b>Viewing of Scan Movies</b><br>
            <br>
            TEAM has the ability to associate an exported "movie" from a
            patient scan. The movie is tied directly to one of the lesions
            in a patients scan. Most current image viewing/processing
            software have the ability to export a movie that can be played
            by the TEAM system. Three of the more popular movie formats
            include mov, mp4, and mpv.<br>
            <br>
            Your TEAM coordinator needs to have worked with your IT
            department or representative to set up this service via the TEAM
            -ADMIN App. Movies images are exported and stored on your TEAM
            server. Your radiologist or the TEAM Coordinator would perform
            the export of each of the movies that they wish to include as
            displayable on TEAM. Those movies would then be uploaded to your
            TEAM server. Special naming of the movies is required to
            associate the movie with a patient. The filename is
            automatically generated for your use on the lesion add/edit
            screens.<br>

                When viewing a movie with TEAM, you can pause and zoom in on an
                area of the image. <br>
