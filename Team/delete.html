        <big><big><b>Deleting Patients, Scans, Lesions, Doctors, Studies</b><br>
            <br>
            There are instances when it is appropriate to delete one of the
            TEAM entries such as a Study. Caution should be taken when
            deleting because there is no undo facility. Your TEAM
            coordinator may have a TEAM backup of the deleted data but maybe
            not.<br>
            <br>
            All of the TEAM data is normally displayed in a scrollable
            table. The following 2 screens show the scrollable tables for
            Patients and Doctors.<br>
            <br>
            <img alt="patients" src="patients-search.tiff"><img alt="doctors"
                src="doctors.tiff"><br>
                <br>
                In order to delete a Doctor you would "swipe" with your finger
                from right to left causing the "Delete" button to appear.<br>
                <br>
                <img alt="delete doctor" src="delete-doctor.tiff"><br>
                    <br>
                    To delete the Doctor you just click on the "Delete" button and
                    the the entry will be removed from both the table and the TEAM
                    data base. <br>
                    <b><br>
                        <font color="#ff0000">Cautionary Notes</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    Deleting an entry in TEAM may end up deleting entries associated
                    with that entry.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you delete an individual lesion in a scan, only that lesion
                    will be deleted.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you delete a scan date, then the scan date will be deleted
                    AND all the lesions that were entered into that scan date.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you delete a Patient, all of the patient's scans and all of
                    the entered lesions for that patient will be deleted.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can delete a study or doctor. Patients assigned to that
                    study and/or doctor will continue to have that study/doctor
                    reported on patient screens and reports.<br>
