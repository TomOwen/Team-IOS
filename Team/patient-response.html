        <big><big><b>Patient Response</b><br>
            <br>
            One of the most important part of a study or clinical trial is
            the determination of how well a patient is responding to
            treatment. One of the ways is to evaluate the individual lesions
            from a patient's scans and evaluate them against the baseline of
            scans at the beginning of the study or trial.<br>
            <br>
            TEAM has implemented logic based upon the RECIST criteria of
            measuring and evaluating whether a patient has responded to
            treatment. Additionally TEAM provides you with the capability to
            set up a study that will use different percentage
            increase/decrease for determining response critieria (i.e. irRC
            etc.).<br><br>Studies that follow the "Immune Related Response Criteria"
             protocol are identified with irrc in the study id. Using irRC, the appearance of new lesions alone does not constitute irPD if they do not add to the tumor burden by at least 25%. Patients with new lesions but an overall tumor burden decrease qualifying for partial response (50% decrease or more) or qualifying for stable disease (<50% decrease to >25% increase) are considered to have irPR or irSD.            <br><br>
            The four basic categories of RECIST response include:<br>
            <br>
        </big></big>
        <div align="center"><big><big><img alt="recist"
            src="recist-info.png"></big></big><br>
        </div>
        <big><big> <br>
            To obtain the patient's response evaluation, choose the "Patient
            Response Evaluation" icon from the "Patient Data" screen.<br>
            <br>
        </big></big>
        <div align="center"><big><big><img alt="patient data"
            src="patient-data.tiff"></big></big><br>
        </div>
        <big><big> <br>
            Choosing </big></big><big><big>"Patient Response Evaluation"
                will direct TEAM to process all of the patients scans and
                provide a Summary response. Scans/lesions are compared against
                the original baseline scan as well as against the "smallest"
                instance of a given lesion since the baseline. This dual
                comparison is identified in the RECIST definitions.<br>
                <br>
            </big></big>
        <div align="center"><big><big><img alt="response"
            src="response.tiff"></big></big><br>
        </div>
        <big><big> <br>
            All of the lesions (Targeted and Non-Targeted) are initially
            displayed in the scrollable view. Each Lesion has 3 lines of
            information:<br>
            <br>
            Line 1: (in Grey) Identifies the Lesion type (Targeted/Non
            Targeted), Lesion #, and Current Size in mm<br>
            Line 2: Identifies the baseline scan date and lesion size at
            baseline as well as the overall % increase or decrease from the
            baseline<br>
            Line 3: Identifies the scan date that this lesion was the
            smallest and determines the overall % increase or decrease from
            that smallest size.<br>
            <br>
            After the scrollable table, a "Summary" response is provided
            based upon RECIST criteria or the custom criteria you may have
            set up.<br>
            <br>
            Two lines are included:<br>
            <br>
            Line 1: The current total tumor burden of all of lesions in the
            most current scan is compared against the total tumor burden
            from the baseline scan. A % increase or decrease from the
            baseline is identified and the RECIST response included (i.e.
            CR, PR, SD, PD).<br>
            <br>
            Line 2: </big></big><big><big>The current total tumor burden of
                all of lesions in the current scan is compared against the total
                tumor burden from the smallest instance of each lesion from all
                previous scans. A % increase or decrease from the baseline is
                identified and the RECIST response included (i.e. CR, PR, SD,
                PD).</big></big><br>
        <big><big><b><br>

        </b>To obtain a full detailed list of the Response and details
            of all of the scans you can click on "Detail".<br>

            All of the pertinent information about the patient is included
            in the is online report. The scan details are listed with the
            most current set of scans at the beginning and the baseline
            scans at the bottom. TEAM automatically calculates the "Week
            Number" beginning from the baseline scan date being week number
            1.<br>
            <br>
            A print button is available in the upper right Tool Bar to allow
            you to print via the AirPrint facility. Most current desk top
            printers that are WI-FI capable will support AirPrinting of your
            report. If you do not have an AirPrint compatible WI-FI printer,
            there free software available to enable a Mac or PC to print to
            the non-AirPrint printers.<br>
