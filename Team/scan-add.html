        <big><big><b>Managing Patient Scans</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big>To add or edit patient scans, first select the patient
            from the patient screen, then choose the "Patient Scans" icon
            which will bring you to the "Scans" screen.<br>
            <br>
            <img alt="scans" src="scans.tiff"><br>
                <br>
                This screen displays all of the scans for the chosen patient in
                scan date order, the most recent scans are first.<br>
                <br>
                Add a New Scan Date<br>
                <br>
                If this is the first set of scans for this patient the screen
                will be empty. Click on the "+" in the top right of the Tool bar
                to add a new scan date.<br>
                <br>
                <img alt="new scan" src="new-scan.tiff"><br>
                    <br>
                    The screen will default the scan date to the current date. If
                    this is acceptable then all you need to do is click on the
                    "Save" button in the top right Tool bar. If you need to set the
                    date to something other than the current date, click on the date
                    and a Date Picker (tool) will appear to allow you to choose the
                    scan date. Once you have chosen the date, click on the "Done"
                    button in the Date Picker and then click on "Save".<br>
                    <br>
                    If this is the first set of scans for this patient, a new empty
                    scan date will be created for you to be able to add Targeted and
                    Non Targeted Lesions. If this is an additional new scan, then
                    TEAM will copy all of the most recent lesion details from the
                    most current set of scans and will populate the new scan with
                    that data. This will save you time and will insure that ALL of
                    the lesions are continually tracked for the patient. Even though
                    a lesion may have resolved (measurement/size of zero) you must
                    continue to track those lesions in each subsequent set of scans
                    in order to get an accurate RECIST response calculation from
                    TEAM. <br>
                    <br>
                    After you have "Saved" the new scan date, you will be presented
                    with the "Scans" screen once again with your new scan date at
                    the bottom of the list of scans. You may have to scroll the
                    screen to reach the bottom. <br>
                    <br>
                    Editing the New or Existing Scan<br>
                    <br>
                    From the "Scans" screen select by clicking on the appropriate
                    scan date for this patient.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img alt="scan details" src="scan-details.tiff"><br>
                        <br>
                        The patient name and the date of the scan will be displayed
                        above the list of lesions.&nbsp; </big></big><big><big>Each
                            lesion will be listed as a Target (T) or a Non-Target (NT). The
                            current size in MM will be displayed and on the second line of
                            the display will be the comments/description information if any.<br>
                            <br>
                            The optional "Online Scan Report" feature of TEAM allows you to
                            view the scan report online. If you choose to have the
                            radiologist scan report or a custom scan report online you will
                            need to do the following:<br>
                            <br>
                            Click on the "Online Scan Report" on/off switch. When you set
                            the switch on TEAM will automatically provide a button link for
                            you to display the scan report. <br>
                            <br>
                            The TEAM system will attempted to display the report using the
                            special filename. In this case the scan report is for patient
                            ID# 100 and the scan date is 08/16/12. <br>
                            <br>
                            The filename then becomes 100-081612.doc<br>
                            <br>
                            This name is unique and should be the filename that your IT
                            personnel uses to store the report on its "server". Your TEAM
                            coordinator sets the name of the server (i.e.
                            http://www.myserver.com/team/) using the TEAM-ADMIN App.<br>
                            <b><br>
                                Add or Edit a Lesion</b><br>
                            <br>
                            You can edit all the lesions by simply clicking on the lesion in
                            the display.<br>
                            <br>
                            <img alt="lesion edit" src="lesion-edit.tiff"><br>
                                <b><br>
                                    Description: </b><br>
                                <br>
                                Add appropriate descriptive information such as image # from
                                scan or general description like left leg.<br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Size:</b><br>
                                <br>
                                Enter the size in mm by either typing on keboard or using the
                                "stepper" to increase or decrease the size by .1 mm at a time.
                                (Note: For Lymph Nodes enter the full short axis measurement)<br>
                                <b><br>
                                    Target Lesion: </b><br>
                                <br>
                                Either turn this on or off depending upon whether this is a
                                target lesion or not.<br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Lymph Node: </b><br>
                                <br>
                                If this is a lymph node set the switch on. This is important
                                because lymph node size is determined to be the size that is
                                greater than 10mm. TEAM automatically compensates for this if
                                you have the Lymph Node switch properly set.<br>
                                <br>
                                Scan Images Online:<br>
                                <br>
                                An optional feature of TEAM provides for the display of&nbsp; an
                                image (jpeg, png etc.). The image needs to be exported or
                                captured from the actual scan image. That file is then uploaded
                                to the TEAM Cloud image and document server.&nbsp; The image
                                type is obtained in the TEAM settings that are maintained by the
                                TEAM Coordinator using the TEAM-ADM App. You can override the
                                file type for any image (i.e. doc instead of jpg).<br>
                                <br>
                                The filename is derived using the Patient ID#, Scan Date, Lesion
                                Number, and File type.<br>
                                <br>
                                So in this example Catherine Reed, Patient #100, scan date of
                                08/16/12, lesion number 3, and jpg as a file type will become a
                                filename of 100-081612-3.jpg<br>
                                <br>
                                The exported (screen grab etc.) image of lesion #3 would be
                                uploaded to your TEAM server (defined in TEAM-ADM) and made
                                available for display on TEAM.<br>
                                <br>
                                <img alt="scan-image" src="scan-image.tiff"><br>
                                    <br>
                                    Add a New Lesion<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To add a new lesion click on the "+" in the top right Tool Bar.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img alt="add lesion" src="add-lesion.tiff"><br>
                                        <br>
                                        All of the fields are the same as editing a lesion except that
                                        you must enter a Lesion Number. This should normally be the next
                                        number. In this example Catherine had 3 previous lesions on this
                                        scan so the next lesion number will be 4.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        If you used the keyboard rather than the steppers (+ &amp; -) to
                                        enter the lesion number or Size, click on the Done button to
                                        remove the keyboard from the screen.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Remember to click on "Save" after you have completed the entry
                                        of data.</big></big><big><big><br>
